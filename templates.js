    "Recruit": `Hi [Name], Dawie here from KW Explore.
I’m connecting with a few agents to compare what’s working and to share how we structure costs, coaching and lead gen so more of your commission stays with you. No pitch, just a short, numbers based business conversation to see if it’s useful.
If you’re open, reply YES and we’ll take it from there. If not, reply STOP and I won’t follow up.
